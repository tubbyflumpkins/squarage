You have access to Context7 and web search if necessary. If anything about the implementation strategy is unclear, ask for clarification before continuining, but it is okay to just go without asking if you feel that it is clear. You cannot run dev servers due to the branched nature of the worktrees, so when you're ready to test, you can add and commit to the branch and notify me that you're ready for me to remove the worktree. The other branches being worked on in parallel are listed in this document for the sake of clarity and maintaining clear boundaries to ensure interoperability and clean merges. Pleaes create a new markdown file for this specific branch in the claude_notes/branch_notes directory to keep track of high level progress on this feature.
