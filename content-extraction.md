# Squarage Studio Content Extraction

## About Section (Perfect as-is)
```
Squarage Studio is an LA-based design studio founded by Dylan and Thomas. We've been building things together for over 20 years—ever since we met in kindergarten. We tiled my dad's pool in 2019 and couldn't believe how good it looked.

Squarage Studio started when we made an end table for my girlfriend for Valentine's Day. Friends wanted their own, so we kept pushing the designs to see how far we could take it. We named each table after the friend it was designed for.

Turns out people liked them so we decided to get serious. We got to work and transformed my garage into a design workshop… we now own a shop vac.

I've been dreaming of running a design studio my whole life. This is it.
